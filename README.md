This repository is intended to be a replacement for the where.sh
script in the basic repository. The purpose of that script is to
locate resources used by specific users.

This version will be better than the previous one because resources
have been relocated to other hosts. At the time this was written the
wikis are split between web.labmed.washington.edu and
docs.labmed.uw.edu. In addition, sudo access was not managed.
